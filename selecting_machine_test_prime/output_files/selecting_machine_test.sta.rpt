Info: Running Quartus Prime Timing Analyzer
    Info: Version 18.1.0 Build 625 09/12/2018 SJ Lite Edition
    Info: Processing started: Fri Nov 30 20:55:01 2018
Info: Command: quartus_sta selecting_machine_test -c selecting_machine_test
Info: qsta_default_script.tcl version: #1
Warning (18236): Number of processors has not been specified which may cause overloading on shared machines.  Set the global assignment NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS in your QSF to an appropriate value for best performance.
Info (20030): Parallel compilation is enabled and will use 4 of the 4 processors detected
Info (21077): Low junction temperature is 0 degrees C
Info (21077): High junction temperature is 85 degrees C
Info (334003): Started post-fitting delay annotation
Info (334004): Delay annotation completed successfully
Critical Warning (332012): Synopsys Design Constraints File file not found: 'selecting_machine_test.sdc'. A Synopsys Design Constraints File is required by the Timing Analyzer to get proper timing constraints. Without it, the Compiler will not properly optimize the design.
Info (332142): No user constrained base clocks found in the design. Calling "derive_clocks -period 1.0"
Info (332096): The command derive_clocks did not find any clocks to derive.  No clocks were created or changed.
Warning (332068): No clocks defined in design.
Info: Found TIMING_ANALYZER_REPORT_SCRIPT_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_ANALYSIS = ON
Info (332159): No clocks to report
Info (332140): No fmax paths to report
Info: Can't run Report Timing Closure Recommendations. The current device family is not supported.
Info (332140): No Setup paths to report
Info (332140): No Hold paths to report
Info (332140): No Recovery paths to report
Info (332140): No Removal paths to report
Info (332140): No Minimum Pulse Width paths to report
Info (332001): The selected device family is not supported by the report_metastability command.
Info (332101): Design is fully constrained for setup requirements
Info (332101): Design is fully constrained for hold requirements
Info: Quartus Prime Timing Analyzer was successful. 0 errors, 3 warnings
    Info: Peak virtual memory: 4703 megabytes
